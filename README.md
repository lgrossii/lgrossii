Hi there i'm Lorenzo, a Computer Science student at Sapienza university of Roma.<br>
Here, you will find some of the projects I've worked on during my studies at Sapienza and my time in 42 school.<br>
Hope you will find something interesting! :grin:

## 42 Projects 
All the projects in this section were developed at 42 and written in C. <br>
I know, they might not showcase the most efficient approaches, and that‚Äôs because 42 has very (very) strict standards to follow (think of it as C programming in hardcore mode üòÜ).
Example: ‚ÄúFor‚Äù loops or any kind of external function (with a few exceptions) that you didn‚Äôt develop yourself are not allowed.
